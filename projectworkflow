🔄 Project Workflow

System Power-Up
The microcontroller initializes all sensors, the relay module, and output indicators. The water pump is set to an inactive state by default.

Continuous Sensor Monitoring
The system repeatedly reads values from:

Flame sensor

Gas sensor

Ultrasonic distance sensor

Data Evaluation
Each reading is compared to predefined thresholds to determine:

Presence of fire

Presence of hazardous gas

Bin fullness level

Hazard Detection Logic

If flame intensity indicates fire or gas level exceeds the safe limit, the system classifies the environment as hazardous.

Bin fullness is checked based on distance measurements.

Automated Response Activation

Relay ON → Water pump activates when fire or gas hazard is detected.

LED ON when the bin reaches the full threshold.

Real-Time Data Feedback
Sensor readings and status messages are output through the Serial Monitor for user observation, debugging, or data logging.

Loop and Re-evaluate
The process repeats continuously, creating a real-time monitoring and response cycle.
